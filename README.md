# Cohomology via Sheaves

I taught this course at Mathcamp 2018.
It introduces the notion of ÄŒech cohomology on graphs and we compute cohomologies of some simple spaces.
The course is designed in an IBL-format - you're expected to solve all the problems in each section before moving to the next and in the process learn the subject.
The prerequisites are linear algebra (over finite fields).
